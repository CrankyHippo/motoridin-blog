# Motoridin Blog

Responsive blog application created and customized for myself to practice hosting and building a fully featured site. Components include featured / recent posts, categories, full markdown articles, author information, comments. Using GraphQL and GraphCMS to create a dedicated CMS, clients can manage the blog. 

The blog itself is a continuing project building on my passion for riding two wheels and web development.
